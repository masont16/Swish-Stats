This program uses 3 years of historical data in order to accurately predict NBA scorelines for the current days games.

When run, the program will automatically return all predicted scorelines for today's games in the NBA.

I used a Random Forest regressor trained with three years of historical data along with 5, 10, and 20 game rolling win rates in order to gauge current form and overall skill of the team.
